    "comment": "Roman is by far one of the best interaction designers I've ever worked with. His discipline, work ethic and enthusiasm are second to none.  He is super-talented, thoughtful, organised and easy to work with.  He showed his biggest strength in dealing with conflicting priorities in high-pressure situations and never lost his cool which is one of the reasons he stands out. He joined my team in a very hectic time, and he found his ground in no time. Roman's skillset truly stands out. He has a deep understanding of design thinking and the user-centric way of problem-solving. Every decision he makes relies on research and thorough thinking. He was seamlessly working together with multiple dev teams, making the always challenging design-dev handshake look like it was easy.  It's without hesitation that I recommend Roman if you are looking for a talented interaction designer with a vast array of skills and a thorough understanding of technology who's not running away from serious responsibilities and will get the job done on an exceptional level.  On a personal note, you were incredible in the most demanding situations and always kept a cool head. Five minutes into your first interview, I knew I wanted to work with you. You surprised me with many things, your hobbies, interests, and that you can meaningfully participate in conversations about practically anything. I learned from you a lot in a very short period of time. I also went through the most challenging time in my life when we worked together, and I'm tremendously grateful for your compassion. Thank you.",
