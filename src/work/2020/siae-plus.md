## Design process

In this project, we used Enterprise Design Thinking and Agile mindset approaches that help us systematically extract, teach, learn, and apply human-centered techniques to solve problems in a creative and innovative way, in our designs related business requirements.

## Interface & branding

### Typography

We paired the current SIAE’s typography with Roboto Condensed. The typeface is a modern take on classic sans-serif faces such as Neuzeit. Its balance of legibility and condensed sensibilty fit well with the SIAE’s branding.

### Color Palette

An accessible colour palette was important that meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA or higher for the contrast between text and background.

### Components

A component library began to emerge. We built out an extensive Figma library and corresponding React Storybook of UI elements that could be used for future customer-facing systems.

## Features

By installing it on your mobile device, the app offers you features like consult your SIAE position, view the payment status of the registration fees and your accrual, activate the electronic signature, create a new deposit and digitally sign the deposit declaration slips, multi-language, the possibility of forwarding requests for assistance or feedback directly via the app.

The two most complex features of the SIAE+ is the registration and the possibility of making a new deposit.

## Custumer reaction

During the first year, we received a lot of positive feedback on the first versions of the app, here’s a medium rating of [Apple’s](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/siae/id1465450346) and [Google’s](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.siae.autorieditori&hl=en_IE&gl=US) stores:

## Software and tools

Since the client is located in another city, we decided to collaborate entirely remotely. Mural allowed us to run workshops with stakeholders.

The complexity of the product was considerable and we needed more than one designer to collaborate in the creation of different flows of the prototypes and Figma allowed us to do so. 

All the product features were added to Jira, which enabled us to keep track of the entire project and keep multiple teams and stakeholders updated on the whole process.
