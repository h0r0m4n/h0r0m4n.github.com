## Problem Definition & Discovery

SIAE, a non-profit organization responsible for managing music copyrights in Italy, faced a crucial challenge in providing its users with a seamless and efficient mobile experience. Their existing app lacked a cohesive design language, lacked consistent navigation, and failed to cater to the diverse needs of its users. This fragmented approach hindered user engagement and hampered SIAE's ability to effectively serve its clients.

To address these issues, SIAE sought to develop a revamped mobile app that would redefine user experience and streamline operations. The goal was to create a unified platform that would provide users with a centralized hub for managing their SIAE-related activities, from registration and deposit filings to accessing payment information and filing appeals.

## My Approach to Resolving the Problem

As the lead designer on this project, I recognized the need to adopt a user-centric approach that would prioritize the needs and preferences of SIAE's users. This involved conducting extensive user research to understand their pain points, expectations, and desired features. Additionally, I collaborated closely with the development team to ensure that the design was not only aesthetically pleasing but also technically feasible.

Throughout the design process, I employed a range of user-centered methodologies, including:

- User Interviews: Conducted in-depth interviews with SIAE users to gain insights into their experiences with the existing app and their expectations for the new one.
- User Testing: Conducted user testing sessions to observe how users interacted with prototypes and identify areas for improvement.
- Personas: Created detailed personas to represent SIAE's target user groups, which helped to shape the design decisions throughout the project.

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the primary challenges was consolidating the fragmented design elements and navigation patterns of the existing app into a cohesive and user-friendly experience. This involved aligning the visual style, typography, and interface components across the app's various features.

Another challenge was the need to accommodate the diverse needs of SIAE's user base, which included musicians, composers, and copyright holders. This required careful consideration of accessibility features, language localization, and support for various devices and operating systems.

To address these challenges, I implemented the following strategies:

- **User Flows**: Developed clear and intuitive user flows that guided users through the app's various features, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience.
- **Pattern Library**: Created a comprehensive design library and components in code that standardized UI elements, color palettes, and typography, ensuring consistency across the app.
- **Accessibility Features**: Integrated comprehensive accessibility features to ensure that the app was usable by individuals with disabilities.
- **Language Localization**: Provided support for multiple languages to cater to SIAE's international user base.

## Features

By installing it on your mobile device, the app offers you features like consult your SIAE position, view the payment status of the registration fees and your accrual, activate the electronic signature, create a new deposit and digitally sign the deposit declaration slips, multi-language, the possibility of forwarding requests for assistance or feedback directly via the app.

The two most complex features of the SIAE+ is the registration and the possibility of making a new deposit.

## Timeline and Results

The SIAE Mobile App project spanned twelve months and involved a team of designers, engineers, and project managers. The collaborative approach and user-centred design methodology adopted throughout the project facilitated efficient decision-making and ensured that the app met the needs of its users.

Launching the new SIAE Mobile App resulted in a remarkable improvement in user engagement and satisfaction. The app was downloaded over 20,000 times in the first four months, with a significant increase in registration rates and deposit filings. Additionally, the app received positive reviews on major app stores, acknowledging its user-friendly design and ease of navigation.

We received a lot of positive feedback on major [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/siae/id1465450346) and [Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.siae.autorieditori&hl=en_IE&gl=US) stores.

## Key Learnings

Throughout the SIAE Mobile App project, I gained valuable insights into the importance of user-centered design and the power of a cohesive design language to enhance user experience. I also learned the importance of effective communication and collaboration among designers, engineers, and stakeholders to ensure the successful delivery of a product that meets the needs of its users.

## Overall Impact

The SIAE Mobile App has played a pivotal role in transforming the way SIAE interacts with its users. By providing a seamless and user-friendly experience, the app has not only improved user satisfaction but also streamlined operations and increased efficiency. As a result, SIAE is better equipped to serve its clients and achieve its business goals.

The success of the SIAE Mobile App project highlights the importance of prioritizing user needs and adopting a user-centered design approach. By carefully considering user feedback, conducting user research, and designing with accessibility in mind, we can create products that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also truly useful and engaging for users.
