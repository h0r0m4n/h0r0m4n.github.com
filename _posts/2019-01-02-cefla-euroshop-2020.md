## Design process

To understand better user's needs and motivations we used user personas that help us to translate to online use and consumption and, ultimately, purchasing decisions.

Starting with Francesco's characteristics, we have developed the three potential personas:

### Data and metrics

During research with our engineers and established some extraordinary data that we could collect and split into two separate categories:

1. Consumer
    - Targeted promotions based on user behavior
    - Total time spent in the shop
    - User routes
    - Hot areas and cold areas for stationing
    - Data timing by time bands
    - Product that consumer is interacting with
    - Frequency of purchase of a given products
    - Purchase history
2. Technical
    - Product out of camera angle
    - Active shelf cameras
    - Request for assistance
    - Number of users entering the store
    - Information on the products on the shelf
    - Out-of-stock products
    - Quantity of products that are expiring

## First release

Since the project had a small deadline we had to do two major releases. The first release was required to get exclusive invitations and a personal free pass to spend an entire day at Euroshop 2020. So that potential consumers could be part of the project right away.

## Support area

Support area for app provides the “admin-level” to support teams with allows to view and edit subscribed users to the product. One of the main features in-app was to be able to filter people labeled as "VIP":
