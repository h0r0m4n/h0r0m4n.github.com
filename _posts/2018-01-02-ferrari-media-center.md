## Some experience made in-house

At the start of my short ten-day engagement, I proposed three possible design directions. Based on the discussion and feedback these generated, I was able to create a logo and associated brand collateral and guidelines.

### Envisage or peronality

As well as envisage the design of an Android app that could bring Rifa’s unique style and flexible learning programme to a global audience.

### Digital experience reimanaged

Through Refigure, Rifa-Thorpe Tracey provides tailor-made mentoring and meditation services for individuals and teams, corporates and non-profits.
