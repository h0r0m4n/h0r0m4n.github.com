## Design process

We kick off our engagements by interviewing stakeholders across Ferrari’s organization. We’ll line up mostly one-on-one interviews, and conduct a slew of 30-45 minute interview sessions over a week or three.

The interviews are about discovering what you don’t know—and often that means uncovering the real questions as you go. So we created more specific questions receiving great results for proceeding to the first exploration and prototypes:

## Features

Since Ferrari’s Media Center offers a wide range of media content such as images, video, audio, and documents. The main goal of the product was to deliver a simple and fast experience during a search for a different type of content.

The product was designed in responsive design and mobile-first approaches.

## Software and tools

All the product features were added to Jira, which enabled us to keep track of the entire project and keep design and engineering teams updated on the process.
