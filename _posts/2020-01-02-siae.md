## Project overview

By installing it on your mobile device, the app offers you features like consult your SIAE position, view the payment status of the registration fees and your accrual, activate the electronic signature, create a new deposit and digitally sign the deposit declaration slips.

The two most complex features of the SIAE+ is the registration and the possibility of making a new deposit.

Finally, the possibility of forwarding requests for assistance or feedback directly via the app it was very useful for us to collect all the feedback from users.

## Tecnical overview

### Software and tools

Since the client is located in another city, we decided to collaborate entirely remotely. Mural allowed us to run workshops with stakeholders.

The complexity of the product was considerable and we needed more than one designer to collaborate in the creation of different flows of the prototypes and Figma allowed us to do so. 

All the product features were added to Jira, which enabled us to keep track of the entire project and keep multiple teams and stakeholders updated on the hole process.
