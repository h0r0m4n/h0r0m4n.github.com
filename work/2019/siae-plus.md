## Design process

Working with a research team, we quantified the impact of usability issues that existed in the SIAE portal and prioritized high-impact issues that would interfere with users' desire to use the mobile app.

After conducting the user test sessions, we realized that the biggest impact problems were the reluctance of users to understand the information architecture along with the user interface. In fact, each SIAE web portal offered a different interface and patterns.

### Goals of the design

Given the user research I outlined the goals for a design of the product as follows:

- **Consistency** – Provide a shared set of principlese and ruoles to components and patterns.
- **Scalability** – Design never ends, everything must be changeable and scalable for the different use cases and business needs.
- **Comprehensive IA** – Provide more semantics for the user and their needs.

## Features

By installing it on your mobile device, the app offers you features like consult your SIAE position, view the payment status of the registration fees and your accrual, activate the electronic signature, create a new deposit and digitally sign the deposit declaration slips, multi-language, the possibility of forwarding requests for assistance or feedback directly via the app.

The two most complex features of the SIAE+ is the registration and the possibility of making a new deposit.

## Custumer reaction

During the first year, we received a lot of positive feedback on the first versions of the app, here’s a medium rating of Apple’s and Google’s stores:

## Software and tools

Since the client is located in another city, we decided to collaborate entirely remotely. Mural allowed us to run workshops with stakeholders.

The complexity of the product was considerable and we needed more than one designer to collaborate in the creation of different flows of the prototypes and Figma allowed us to do so. 

All the product features were added to Jira, which enabled us to keep track of the entire project and keep multiple teams and stakeholders updated on the whole process.
